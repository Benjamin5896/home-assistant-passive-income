# Home Assistant Passive Income

This repository contains a collection of Home Assistant add-ons
for running various passive income applications on a Home Assistant.
These applications allow you to generate income through proxy services,
bandwidth sharing, and more right from your home network.

Each application is packaged as an add-on,
making it easy to install and manage directly from Home Assistant.
The goal of this project is to provide a streamlined solution for users interested
in setting up multiple passive income streams with minimal technical effort.
